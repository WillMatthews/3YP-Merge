abstract = {The phenomenon of catalysis is found in many homogeneous and heterogeneous systems undergoing chemical change, where it effects the rates of approach to the equilibrium state in processes as diverse as those found in the stars, the earth's mantle, living organisms, and the various chemistries utilized by industry. The economies and the living standards of both developed and developing countries depend to varying degrees upon the efficacy of their chemical industries. Con sequently, this century has seen a wide exploration and expansion of catalytic chemistry together with an intensive investigation of specific, essential processes like those contributing to life-supporting agricultures. Prime among the latter must surely be the "fixation" of atmospheric nitrogen by catalytic hydrogenation to anhydrous ammonia, still the preferred synthetic precursor of the nitrogenous components of fertilizers. In each decade contemporary concepts and techniques have been used to further the understanding, as yet incomplete, of the catalyst, the adsorbates, the surface reactions, and the technology of large-scale operation. The contributors to the present volume review the state of the art, the science, and the technology; they reveal existing lacunae, and suggest ways forward. Around the turn of the century, Sabatier's school was extending the descriptive catalytic chemistry of hydrogenation by metals to include almost all types of multiple bond. The triple bond of dinitrogen, which continued to be more resistant than the somewhat similar bonds in carbon monoxide and ethyne, defied their efforts.},

abstract = {This book brings together information which is used by engineers, and needed especially by students of engineering, but difficult to find in a collected form. In this respect engineering, perhaps because it is more often divided into separate branches, has so far been less well served than the other physical sciences; we hope to have in part redressed the balance. The contents are designed chiefly for engineering students of all kinds in universities and colleges, but they should also prove useful to practising engineers as a general reference. There was some difficulty in choosing numerical values for parts of the section Properties of Matter. Information was culled from a range of sources which sometimes show an alarming lack of consistency. Given a choice, we have used values which are either average or more likely to be reliable. The degree of tolerance required varies very widely between, for example, the precision to which thermodynamic proper ties of steam are known and the uncertainty in those mechanical properties of solids which depend strongly on quality and preparation.

The constants of the linear relation involve particle specific surface, fractional void volume, and fluid viscosity. These constants can be used to predict the degree of bed expansion with increasing gas flow after the pressure gradient reaches the buoyant weight of solids per unit volume of the bed. Formal equations are developed that permit estimation of gas flow rates corresponding to incidence of turbulent or two-phase fluidization-a state of flow in which gas bubbles, with entrained solids, rise through the bed and cause intense circulation of solids. A constant product of gas viscosity times superficial velocity may serve as a criterion of a standard state in fluidized systems usei:t for reaction kinetic studies.},

With the synthesis reactor operated at high-pressure levels and with synthesis gas made of hydrogen and nitrogen, a highly efficient process design is necessary in order to meet the requirements in terms of cost-efficiency and environmental impact. The evaluation and optimization of different designs in the process synthesis phase are generally done by considering mass and energy balances. However, the conclusions drawn from such an analysis can be misleading and provide, if any, little useful information with respect to system improvement. In order to address these issues, an exergy analysis is used to identify the real thermodynamic inefficiencies of a system and its components. Furthermore, a subsequently conducted advanced exergy analysis provides the means to determine the structural interactions within a system and the thermodynamic improvement potential of its components. In this context, two different ammonia synthesis loop configurations are analyzed. The first concept consists of a three-staged adiabatic reactor with intermediate quench cooling, whereas the second design features a cooled reactor.},

An additional factor is its ability to form denser-than-air mixtures on release to the atmosphere, in spite of its low molecular weight relative to that of air. Observational and theoretical evidence is reviewed that demonstrates the formation of such mixtures. It is shown that the combination of factors determining the density of the mixture is highly dependent on the mode of containment and the details of the mode of containment-failure; the physical properties of ammonia and the meteorological variables also have an important influence. Suggestions are made for investigations that are needed in order to improve the confidence with which a given release can be assigned to a particular density regime.

The current understanding and enlightenment from foundation and development of ammonia synthesis catalyst are reviewed, and its future and facing new challenge remained today are expected. Catalytic ammonia synthesis technology has played a central role in the development of the chemical industry during the 20th century. During 100 years, ammonia synthesis catalyst has come through diversified seedtime such as Fe3O4-based iron catalysts, Fe1-xO-based iron catalysts, ruthenium-based catalysts, and discovery of a Co-Mo-N system. Often new techniques, methods, and theories of catalysis have initially been developed and applied in connection with studies of this system. Similarly, new discoveries in the field of ammonia synthesis have been extended to other fields of catalysis. There is no other practically relevant reaction that leads to such a close interconnection between theory, model catalysis, and experiment as the high-pressure synthesis of ammonia. Catalytic synthesis ammonia reaction is yet a perfect model system for academic research in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Understanding the mechanism and the translation of the knowledge into technical perfection has become a fundamental criterion for scientific development in catalysis research. The never-ending story has not ended yet. In addition to questions about the elementary steps of the reaction and the importance of the real structure and subnitrides for the catalyst efficiency, as well as the wide-open question about new catalyst materials, there are also different challenges thrown down by theory for the experimentalist in the prediction of a biomimetic ammonia-synthesis path at room temperature and atmospheric pressure including electrocatalysis, photocatalysis and biomimetic nitrogen fixation.},

Comparison of the SEM images and the results of EDX analyses of the raw and the modified DE confirmed the surface modification of the raw DE with the trimetal oxide. Groundwater fluoride removal capacity of the sorbent was evaluated by batch method at various defluoridation conditions. At a sorbent dosage of 0.6g/100mL (contact time: 60min, mixing speed of 200rpm and temperature: 297K), the fluoride removal was {\textgreater}93{\%} for solutions containing initial fluoride concentration of 10-60mg/L. Sorbent's optimum fluoride uptake capacity was 12.63mg/g at the initial fluoride concentration of 100mg/L. Fluoride removal was {\textgreater}91{\%} for solutions with initial pH range of ∼4-11 (initial fluoride concentration: 9mg/L, sorbent dosage: 0.6g/100mL). Appraisal of the effect of co-existing anions on fluoride removal showed that CO32- would reduce the amount of fluoride removed from solution, while other anions such as PO43-, NO3- and SO42- had no observable effect. K2SO4 solution was found to be most suitable for regeneration of spent Mg/Ce/Mn oxide-modified DE compared to Na2CO3 and NaOH. The mechanism of fluoride removal at pH{\textgreater}5.45 (pHpzc=5.45) occurred by exchange of hydroxyl groups on surface of sorbent with fluoride ions from solution. Sorption data fitted better to Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order model. External diffusion was observed to be the sorption rate limiting factor.},

abstract = {Process simulation represents an important tool for plant design and optimization, either applied to well established or to newly developed processes. Suitable thermodynamic packages should be selected in order to properly describe the behavior of reactors and unit operations and to precisely define phase equilibria. Moreover, a detailed and representative kinetic scheme should be available to predict correctly the dependence of the process on its main variables. This review points out some models and methods for kinetic analysis specifically applied to the simulation of catalytic processes, as a basis for process design and optimization. Attention is paid also to microkinetic modelling and to the methods based on first principles, to elucidate mechanisms and independently calculate thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Different case studies support the discussion. At first, we have selected two basic examples from the industrial chemistry practice, e.g., ammonia and methanol synthesis, which may be described through a relatively simple reaction pathway and the relative available kinetic scheme. Then, a more complex reaction network is deeply discussed to define the conversion of bioethanol into syngas/hydrogen or into building blocks, such as ethylene. In this case, lumped kinetic schemes completely fail the description of process behavior. Thus, in this case, more detailed—e.g., microkinetic—schemes should be available to implement into the simulator. However, the correct definition of all the kinetic data when complex microkinetic mechanisms are used, often leads to unreliable, highly correlated parameters. In such cases, greater effort to independently estimate some relevant kinetic/thermodynamic data through Density Functional Theory (DFT)/ab initio methods may be helpful to improve process description.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to review the literature on the principles governing gravity- driven separation of liquid-vapor mixtures, review design methods for separators, and develop a model that predicts separator performance given operating requirements (i.e. size or velocity, and design droplet size) subject to design constraints. The model presented can serve as a basis to establish a fundamentals-based new design method for gravity separators. It is not the purpose of this paper to develop or recommend design guidelines; rather it is a literature search and analysis to put the existing design guidelines on the same basis for ammonia. The paper summarizes landmark literature in the history of gravity separation and reviews the assumptions made in both the literature and the techniques developed in the paper. Equations of motion that define the droplet trajectories in both vertical and horizontal vessels are presented and implemented in a computer model. Results of in-depth analysis aimed at characterizing liquid-vapor separation in both vertical and horizontal vessels are presented. ASHRAE recommendations for vessel sizing are quantified using the techniques developed in this paper. Other author's recommendations for vertical vessel sizing are also analyzed and compared to the ASHRAE recommendations. A design example is presented for both vertical and horizontal vessels.},

abstract = {Ammonia is one of the most important and widely produced chemicals worldwide with a key role in the growth of human population. Nowadays, the main route for ammonia synthesis is the Haber-Bosch process, developed a century ago. In this process, Fe-based catalysts are usually employed at temperatures between 400 and 500 °C and pressures between 130 and 170 bar. As opposed to the industrial process, in nature, plants and bacteria have been producing ammonia for millions of years at mild conditions. Atmospheric nitrogen is reduced by solvated protons on the FeMo cofactor of the metalloenzyme nitrogenase. The natural method of nitrogen fixation has motivated several research groups to explore the electrochemical synthesis of ammonia at ambient pressure. Since it was first demonstrated in 1998, the electrochemical synthesis has been studied in a variety of experimental configurations over a wide temperature range (25–800 °C). In the present review, the progress of this method in both solid and liquid electrolyte cells is reported. The experimental studies are divided into high (T {\textgreater} 500 °C), intermediate (500 °C {\textgreater} T {\textgreater} 100 °C) and low (T {\textless} 100 °C) temperatures. The experimental observations are comparatively discussed with theoretical predictions based on DFT calculations. The techno-economic advantages and disadvantages of the electrochemical approach, as well as the requirements to be met in order to enable practical applications are also analyzed.},

abstract = {In the December 2014 tip of the month (TOTM) [1], we discussed troubleshooting of gas-liquid separators for removal of liquids from the gas stream leaving the separator. There are two methods for sizing gas-liquid separators: 1. Droplet settling theory method, 2. Souders-Brown approach. Historically the Souders-Brown equation has been employed as it can provide reasonable results and is easy to use, but has shortcomings in terms of quantifying separator performance. References [2-4] provide the details on the droplet settling theory methods which can be used to more accurately quantify separator performance. The Souders-Brown method is limited in that it is based on the average droplet size, but cannot quantify the amount of liquid droplets exiting the gas gravity section. In this TOTM, we will focus on the application of Souders-Brown approach in gas-liquid separators and present diagram, simple correlations and tables to estimate the Souders-Brown equation constant, KS (the so called sizing parameter). We will consider both vertical and horizontal gas-liquid separators. Knowing the actual gas flow rate through the vessel, one can use KS parameter to determine the maximum allowable gas velocity through the vessel and determine the required separator diameter. One can also use the appropriate value of KS to size the mist extractor in the vessel. The performance of a gas-liquid separator is highly dependent on the value of KS; therefore, the choice of appropriate KS –values is important. Gas Gravity Separation Section The gas gravity separation section of a separator has two main functions: 1. Reduction of entrained liquid load not removed by the inlet device 2. Improvement / straightening of the gas velocity profile. Most mist extractors have limitations on the amount of entrained liquid droplets that can be efficiently removed from the gas, thus the importance of the gas gravity section to remove the liquids to an acceptable level upstream of the mist extractor. This is particularly important for separators handling higher liquid loads. For scrubber applications with low liquid loadings, the KS –values will be primarily dependent on the mist extractor type, and the gas gravity separation},

abstract = {A set of kinetic tests on a promoted Ru/C catalyst for ammonia synthesis has been carried out under industrially relevant reaction conditions (T= 370-460�C, P = 50-100 bar). The results have been elaborated by using some kinetic models either derived from literature or here-developed. The best results, as for fitting and consistency of the optimized parameters, were obtained by simply modifying the Temkin equation with the addition of H 2 and NH3 adsorption terms, to take into account their inhibiting effect on catalyst performance. Such an equation can be advantageously applied for better design and operation of ammonia synthesis reactors using Ru/C catalysts. The activation energy for the synthesis reaction was 23 kcal/mol, much lower than that previously found for Fe-based catalysts. From a practical point of view, it has been shown that the working pressure can be decreased, with the same plant productivity, by 40-50{\%} when using the present Ru/C catalyst. Likewise, the ammonia concentration in the exit gas can be increased by about the same value if the working pressure is not decreased. � 2006 American Chemical Society},

The Co3Mo3N phase was observed in the XRD pattern of as-prepared sample and acted as the active component for the reaction. The XPS analysis clarified the existence of Cs species, indicating that these species should be dispersed over Co3Mo3N. The addition of a small amount of Cs species significantly improved the catalytic performance of the Co3Mo3N catalyst. The further addition of Cs species had a negative effect on the catalytic activity for the reaction.15NH3isotopic studies revealed that the nitrogen species in Co3Mo3N were exchangeable with nitrogen atoms in gas phase, elucidating the mechanism of the reaction over the Co3Mo3N catalysts. The kinetics analysis indicated that the modification by a small amount of Cs species alleviated the negative effect of the hydrogen poisoning on the active sites of Co3Mo3N catalysts. The desorption behavior of hydrogen and nitrogen suggested that the Cs modification facilitated the recombinative desorption of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms from the active components, resulting in the improvement in the activity of Co3Mo3N. This improvement was due to the electronic modification of Co3Mo3N by the electron donation of Cs promoter.},

abstract = {Catalytic decomposition of ammonia with complete conversion for generating hydrogen at low temperature ({\textless}450 °C) is getting much attention, as onsite hydrogen generation from ammonia bypasses the challenges of hydrogen storage and transportation. Ammonia is a carbon-free hydrogen carrier with a reasonably good volumetric and gravimetric energy density that has available technology for efficient storage and transportation. The state-of-the-art catalysts for decomposition of ammonia are ruthenium doped with potassium, barium and cesium and supported on various oxides and carbon supports; these catalysts are still not sufficiently active for low temperature NH3decomposition, and, more importantly, will not be economically viable for large-scale applications. This review provides a comprehensive consideration of recent development of various types of nonprecious transition metal catalysts. Proposed mechanisms of ammonia decomposition on various transition metals are examined, and theoretical bases for the design of future catalysts are presented, including the role of electronic promoters and supports. Among studied catalyst formulations, this review emphasizes transition metal nitride-lithium imide composites where a synergy offers great promise for the efficient decomposition of ammonia at low temperatures. Development of such catalysts will make hydrogen storages, transportation, and generation from ammonia a feasible technology for fuel cells and other energy applications.},

Different reactor configurations are compared. The comparison between a single fixed bed reactor (FBR) and a single fixed bed membrane reactor (FBMR) shows that the FBMR is superior to the FBR and gives 60.48{\%} ammonia conversion higher than the FBR. However, 20.91{\%} exit ammonia conversion obtained by the FBMR is considered to be poor. The FBMR is limited by the kinetics at low temperatures. The numerical results show that the MSFBMR of four beds achieve 100.0{\%} ammonia conversion. It was found that the membrane plays the prime role in the displacement of the thermodynamic equilibrium. The results also show that, a linear relationship exists between the number of beds and the feed temperature and a correlation has been developed. A critical point for an effective hydrogen permeation zone has been identified. It is observed that the diffusion limitation is confined to a slim region at the entrance of the reactor. It is also observed that the heat load assumes a maximum inflection point and explanations offered.

abstract = {Ammonia production with offshore wind power has the potential to transform energy and fertilizer markets within the United States. The vast offshore wind resource can be converted directly into liquid ammonia using existing technologies. The liquid ammonia can then be transported around the country via rail, truck, barge or pipeline and used as either a fertilizer or a fuel. This thesis reviews the technologies required for all-electric, wind-powered ammonia production and offers a simple design of such a system. Cost models based on the physical equipment necessary to produce ammonia with wind power are developed; offshore wind farm cost models are also developed for near-shore, shallow, wind farms in the United States. The cost models are capable of calculating the capital costs of small industrial-sized ammonia plants coupled with an offshore wind farm. A case study for a utility-tied, all-electric ammonia plant in the Gulf of Maine is used to assess the lifetime economics of such a system. Actual utility grid prices and offshore wind are incorporated into a systems-level simulation of the ammonia plant. The results show that significant utility grid backup is required for an all-electric ammonia plant built with present-day technologies. The levelized cost of one metric ton of ammonia is high relative to ammonia produced with natural gas or coal, but is not as susceptible to spikes in ammonia feedstock prices. A sensitivity analysis shows that the total levelized cost of ammonia is driven in large part by the cost of producing electricity with offshore wind. Major cost reductions are possible for systems that have long lifetimes, low operations and maintenance costs, or for systems that qualify for Renewable Energy Credits.},

abstract = {The wide-spread implementation of the so-called hydrogen economy is currently partially limited by an economically feasible way of storing hydrogen. In this context, ammonia has been commonly presented as a viable option for chemical storage due its high hydrogen content (17.6 wt{\{}{\%}{\}}). However, its use as an energy carrier requires the development of catalytic systems capable of releasing hydrogen at adequate rates and conditions. At the moment, the most active catalytic systems for the decomposition of ammonia are based on ruthenium, however its cost and scarcity inhibit the wide scale use of these catalysts. This issue has triggered research on the development of alternative catalysts based on more sustainable systems using more readily available, non-noble metals mainly iron, cobalt and nickel as well as a series of transition metal carbides and nitrides and bimetallic systems, which are reviewed herein. There have been some promising cobalt- and nickel-based catalysts reported for the decomposition of ammonia but metal dispersion needs to be increased in order to become more attractive candidates. Conversely, there seems to be less scope for improvement of iron-based catalysts and metal carbides and nitrides. The area with the most potential for improvement is with bimetallic catalysts, particularly those consisting of cobalt and molybdenum.},

abstract = {The reaction mechanism of ammonia decomposition to nitrogen and hydrogen over platinum loaded titanium oxide photocatalyst was investigated through various reaction tests, as well as ESR and FT-IR spectroscopies. The photoformed hole on the titanium oxide oxidizes NH3 to form amide radical (?NH2) and proton. The amide radicals produce hydrazine (N2H4), and it can be further decomposed to form nitrogen and hydrogen. On the other hand, the photoformed electron migrates to platinum nanoparticles through the conduction band of the titanium oxide and reduces the proton to yield hydrogen. The metals with larger work function, such as platinum, can provide more effective cocatalysts. In this photocatalytic reaction system, water molecules were essential for the continuous reaction progress. An in situ FT-IR study clarified that water restricted the accumulation of inactive byproduct, ammonium ion (NH4+), on the titanium oxide surface.},

abstract = {This work investigates the prospect of producing ammonia from a wind turbine in order to displace diesel fuel requirements on isolated islands. In the proposed system, wind power is used to produce carbon-free ammonia fuel directly from water and air using traditional air separation units, alkaline electrolyzers, mechanical vapor compression desalination and a Haber-Bosch synthesis loop. The ability to produce synthetic fuel on site is potentially valuable both because it mitigates fuel transportation costs and insulates islanders from oil price fluctuations. A general overview of the process and required components is given. The analytical model used to calculate the technical and economic performance is summarized. Monhegan Island in Maine is used as a case study for a wind-powered ammonia production facility to demonstrate the potential of ammonia fuel production. Actual wind data and electrical load data from Monhegan Island are incorporated to determine the expected ammonia production. The results are compared to the existing system in which all fuels and electricity are ultimately derived from petroleum-based fuel. Total lifetime system costs are calculated with the results normalized so that the wind-ammonia system can be directly compared to a conventional diesel-only system. A breakeven diesel price is calculated at which wind-powered ammonia production becomes competitive. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This reactor which is under the license of Kellogg Company is equipped with three axial flow catalyst beds and an internal heat exchanger in accompany with a cooling flow. The achieved modeling is one dimensional and non-homogenous. Considering the sever effect of internal heat exchanger on reactor operation, it has been simulated by calculation of film heat transfer coefficients in its tube and shell and then, taking into account the shell thermal resistance and fouling coefficient, obtaining the overall heat transfer coefficient. So in the developed software, the heat transfer coefficient is first calculated using the conditions of the input flow to the exchanger and then the input flows to the first and second beds are calculated. The differential equations have been solved using Rung Kutta 4 method and the results have been compared with the available industrial data. Finally the capability of the developed software for industrial application has been investigated by changing the reactor operation conditions and studying their effects on reactor output.},

abstract = {This study analyzes and compares the economics and sustainability aspects of two hydrogenation processes for producing renewable methanol and ammonia by using wind-power based electrolytic hydrogen. Carbon dioxide from an ethanol plant is used for producing methanol, while the nitrogen is supplied by an Air Separation Unit (ASU) for producing ammonia. The capacities are 99.96 mt/day methanol and 1202.55 mt/day anhydrous ammonia. The methanol plant requires 138.37 mt CO2/day and 19.08 mt H2/day. The ammonia is synthesized by using 217.72 mt H2/day and 1009.15 mt N2/day. The production costs and the carbon equivalent emissions (CO2e) associated with the methanol and ammonia processes, electrolytic hydrogen production, carbon capture and compression, and ASU are estimated. The integral facilities of both the methanol and ammonia productions are evaluated by introducing a multi-criteria decision matrix containing economics and sustainability metrics. Discounted cash flow diagrams are established to estimate the economic constraints, unit product costs, and unit costs of hydrogen. The hydrogen cost is the largest contributor to the economics of the plants. For the methanol, the values of emissions are -0.85 kg CO2e/kg methanol as a chemical feedstock and +0.53 kg CO2e/kg methanol as a fuel with complete combustion. For the ammonia, the value of emission is around 0.97 kg CO2e/kg ammonia. The electrolytic hydrogen from wind power helps reduce the emissions; however, the cost of hydrogen at the current level adversely affects the feasibility of the plants. A multi-criteria decision matrix shows that renewable methanol and ammonia with wind power-based hydrogen may be feasible compared with the nonrenewable ones and the renewable methanol may be more favorable than the ammonia.},

abstract = {With urbanization of coastal cities, marine pollution is becoming a severe problem. The rates of biodegradation, decomposition, and ratification of pollutants get slowed down due to salinity. The higher temperatures prevalent in tropical regions significantly affect reaction rates. Multiple factors influence the rate of biodegradation, making the process complex. Hence, prediction and evaluation of the assimilative capacity of the marine environment due to wastewater discharges is becoming a difficult task. Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) is a wet oxidation process, which follows first-order kinetics. The values of kinetic rate constants are expected to differ with varying salinities and temperatures. Research is carried out using glucose-glutamic acid and domestic wastewater to evaluate the impact of salinity on biodegradation of carbonaceous waste at 20C and 27C. The findings confirm the hypothesis of slow biodegradation of carbonaceous organic matter in marine waters. An inverse relationship between rate of biodegradation and salinity was observed. BOD exertion at 20C (5days) and 27C (3days) for the marine environment is comparable at selected salinities thereby confirming the validity of BOD test of shorter duration at elevated temperature.},

abstract = {Downscaling simulations performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were used to determine the large-scale wind energy potential of Iceland. Local wind speed distributions are represented by Weibull statistics. The shape parameter across Iceland varies between 1.2 and 3.6, with the lowest values indicative of near-exponential distributions at sheltered locations, and the highest values indicative of normal distributions at exposed locations in winter. Compared with summer, average power density in winter is increased throughout Iceland by a factor of 2.0–5.5. In any season, there are also considerable spatial differences in average wind power density. Relative to the average value within 10 km of the coast, power density across Iceland varies between 50 and 250{\%}, excluding glaciers, or between 300 and 1500 W m−2 at 50 m above ground level in winter. At intermediate elevations of 500–1000 m above mean sea level, power density is independent of the distance to the coast. In addition to seasonal and spatial variability, differences in average wind speed and power density also exist for different wind directions. Along the coast in winter, power density of onshore winds is higher by 100–700 W m−2 than that of offshore winds. Based on these results, 14 test sites were selected for more detailed analyses using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP).},

The ammonia-assisted renewable energy system satisfies specific power (and possibly ammonia) demands. This study reviews the options for the technical components of such a system. We present a mathematical model developed for evaluating the technical performance and economic costs of the system configured with various options at the individual components level.

abstract = {The phenomenon of catalysis is found in many homogeneous and heterogeneous systems undergoing chemical change, where it effects the rates of approach to the equilibrium state in processes as diverse as those found in the stars, the earth's mantle, living organisms, and the various chemistries utilized by industry. The economies and the living standards of both developed and developing countries depend to varying degrees upon the efficacy of their chemical industries. Con sequently, this century has seen a wide exploration and expansion of catalytic chemistry together with an intensive investigation of specific, essential processes like those contributing to life-supporting agricultures. Prime among the latter must surely be the "fixation" of atmospheric nitrogen by catalytic hydrogenation to anhydrous ammonia, still the preferred synthetic precursor of the nitrogenous components of fertilizers. In each decade contemporary concepts and techniques have been used to further the understanding, as yet incomplete, of the catalyst, the adsorbates, the surface reactions, and the technology of large-scale operation. The contributors to the present volume review the state of the art, the science, and the technology; they reveal existing lacunae, and suggest ways forward. Around the turn of the century, Sabatier's school was extending the descriptive catalytic chemistry of hydrogenation by metals to include almost all types of multiple bond. The triple bond of dinitrogen, which continued to be more resistant than the somewhat similar bonds in carbon monoxide and ethyne, defied their efforts.},

abstract = {superhydrophobic surfaces can be used to reduce the minimum voltage and to increase the maximum speed under certain conditions, but there are some harmful side-effects. First of all, the electrostatic pressure can push water into the surface pores, which hinders actuation. The phenomenon can also be treated as a vertical electrowetting effect. Another drawback is that the use of superhydrophobic surfaces makes actuation more critical to the properties of the liquid. For example, actuation of biological buffer solutions was not successful. For these reasons, it is concluded that it is more beneficial to use a smooth surface with low hysteresis than a superhydrophobic surface in droplet actuation. Electrostatic droplet actuation is a potential method for manipulating liquid on a microscopic scale, but there is still work to do. This work contains a detailed examination of the droplet actuation mechanism, and trapping of charges in the solid-liquid interface is found to be the most severe problem that needs to be solved.},

abstract = {Abstract Synthesis of ammonia on iron catalysts was discovered in 1905. Five years later, an iron catalyst containing two promoters, alumina and potassium oxide, was invented by a team of Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik (BASF). The first high-pressure ammonia plant went on stream in 1913. Thus it took only 8 years between discovery, invention, and innovation, a remarkable record considering the novelty at the time of high-pressure operation [1]. Also noteworthy is the fact that the original BASF iron catalyst is still in use today although additional promoters are added to the two original ones in various commercial formulations [2]. In fact, recent advances in ammonia manufacture have been largely of an engineering nature [3]. This is so in spite of a very large amount of fundamental and applied work designed to elucidate the mechanism of the reaction and the surface chemistry of commercial or alternative catalysts.},

A positive effect of cobalt addition into the wustite structure of the iron catalyst on increasing in the catalyst catalytic activity in the ammonia synthesis reaction, lowering a temperature, at which catalysts achieved the maximum reduction rate, decreasing values of the apparent activation energy of obtained catalysts, and increasing resistance to the overheating process was observed. All the results were compared with the results obtained for the industrial magnetite-based iron catalyst.},

abstract = {Fused iron catalyst is an active and classical catalyst both for ammonia synthesis and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis which are two typical industrial processes. As it is of significance to catalysis science as well as its importance to industry, fused iron catalyst is an ideal model system for heterogeneous catalysis research. However, the precursors of fused iron catalysts were confined to Fe3O4in the most studies. The discovery of w{\"{u}}stite (Fe1-xO) based catalyst is a key innovation for fused iron catalyst which necessitates the further research to obtain deeper insight into this novel catalyst. This paper summarized three major scientific issues involved in the development of w{\"{u}}stite based catalyst, namely, the physicochemical properties, characteristics of w{\"{u}}stite, as well as the mechanism leading to the high activity. Based on this novel catalyst, new concepts and opinions were proposed, and the insights and principles obtained are as follow. Hump like activity trend of reduced catalyst was first obtained with varying of Fe2+/Fe3+in the catalyst precursor. Molecular ratio of iron oxides, single phase theory and structure of active sites were suggested to elucidate the high activity of w{\"{u}}stite based catalyst. In addition, new concepts and opinions such as the disproportionation of metastable w{\"{u}}stite and its inhibition, matching of promoters with the structural characteristics of w{\"{u}}stite, synergy between acidic site and basic site on the surface of catalyst, role of Al2O3in the re-structuring of catalyst surface, mechanism of competitive reduction, strong H2adsorption, active sites, micro-structure of $\alpha$-Fe and the essence of high activity were proposed to bring light to the structure-activity relationship forming the theory system with single phase theory as the kernel of w{\"{u}}stite catalyst. These regularities and the theory system significantly promoted and enriched the scientific knowledge of fused iron catalyst. It is unexpected that a knowledge based improvement of a catalyst would have a strong effect on other fields of catalysis research.},

	abstract = {Ammonia was synthesized by reducing NO3-/NO2-over several bimetallic surfaces, supported on H+conducting Nafion-117 polymer. When Pd was used alone as a cathode, the cent percent product was ammonia but the process was kinetically unfavorable (2.3 × 10-3min-1) during nitrite reduction. Under the same experimental conditions, Pt-Pd, Ni-Pd, Ag-Pd and Cu-Pd cathodes were mainly selective to NH4+(69-82{\%}) but nitrite reduction activity was still low (≤8.1 × 10-3min-1). The Rh-Pd was only one cathode, which simultaneously enhanced nitrate (21.1 × 10-3min-1) and nitrite (25.6 × 10-3min-1) reduction yielding ca. 75{\%} of NH4+. The cyclic voltammetric investigations as well as catalytic hydrogenation experiments indicated that the surface to substrate electron transfer reaction was the main reason of ammonia formation. It was noticed that multi functional roles of the Nafion membrane enhanced the ammonia synthesis performance of the electrolyte reactor. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Computers and Chemical Engineering, 28, 219-234] to the ammonia synthesis process. Three modes of operation are considered: (I) given feed rate, (IIa) maximum throughput, and (IIb) "optimized" throughput. Two control structures, one for Mode I and another for Mode IIb, are proposed. In Mode I, it is proposed to keep constant purge rate and compressor powers. There is no bottleneck in the process, and thus there is no Mode IIa of operation. In Mode IIb, the compressors are at their maximum capacity and it is proposed to adjust the feed rate such that the inert concentration is constant. The final control structures result in good dynamic performance. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
