\subsection{Conclusion}

This section on power control and plant simulation was overall successful.
The simulation proved useful in obtaining scaling figures for the plant, which were used in other sections, as well as validating the control scheme designed.

The controller survived far harsher conditions than those in reality, so robustness has been tested and the control scheme validated for the simplified case.
In the case of real data applied the system, the maximum frequency error delta is no more than $4 \text{rads}^-1$ which is within desired bounds.
The material flows were validated to show the plant's scale is correct to a first order approximation, and the plant is in fact viable for this location.
