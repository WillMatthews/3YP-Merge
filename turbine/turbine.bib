abstract = {SUMMARYThis paper evaluates the potential of hydrogen (H2) and ammonia (NH3) as carbon‐free fuels. The combustion characteristics and NOx formation in the combustion of H2 and NH3 at different air‐fuel equivalence ratios and initial H2 concentrations in the fuel gas were experimentally studied. NH3 burning velocity improved because of increased amounts of H2 atom in flame with the addition of H2. NH3 burning velocity could be moderately improved and could be applied to the commercial gas engine together with H2 as fuels. H2 has an accelerant role in H2–NH3–air combustion, whereas NH3 has a major effect on the maximum burning velocity of H2–NH3–air. In addition, fuel‐NOx has a dominant role and thermal‐NOx has a negligible role in H2–NH3–air combustion. Thermal‐NOx decreases in H2–NH3–air combustion compared with pure H2–air combustion. NOx concentration reaches its maximum at stoichiometric combustion. Furthermore, H2 is detected at an air‐fuel equivalence ratio of 1.00 for the decomposition of NH3 in flame. Hence, the stoichiometric combustion of H2 and NH3 should be carefully considered in the practical utilization of H2 and NH3 as fuels. H2 as fuel for improving burning performance with moderate burning velocity and NOx emission enables the utilization of H2 and NH3 as promising fuels. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}

@article{Nozari2015,
abstract = {Abstract With its high hydrogen density and already existing infrastructure, ammonia (NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) is believed to be an excellent green fuel that can be used in energy generation and transportation systems. Combustion of ammonia has certain challenges (associated with its low flame speed and fuel bond NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emissions) that need to be addressed before its widespread use in practical systems. The primary objective of this study is to develop a reduced reaction mechanism for the combustion of ammonia which can be used to expedite the design of effective ammonia combustors through numerical simulations of realistic combustor geometries with accurate kinetics models. First we have investigated the combustion characteristics of NH{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/air mixtures at elevated pressure and lean conditions which are encountered in practical systems such as gas turbine combustors. Laminar premixed freely propagating flame model is used to calculate the combustion properties. The results of sensitivity study of total NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} formation with respect to the equivalence ratio indicates the possibility of localized rich combustion as an effective way to reduce the NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentration down to levels that are the same order as the modern gas turbine engines. In the second part of the study, by considering a wide range of conditions in terms of pressure, fuel mixture, and equivalence ratio we have developed two reduced mechanisms based on the Konnov mechanism. The reduced mechanisms are capable of predicting the total NO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}x{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} emission level and the laminar flame speed at an acceptable accuracy over a wide range of conditions. Evaluating the performance of the reduced mechanisms with respect to the full mechanism and experimental data shows that the mechanisms are able to predict the combustion properties almost at the same accuracy level as the Konnov mechanism, but at a nearly five times less CPU time expense.},
